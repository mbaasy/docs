# Client API - Uploading Google Play Receipts

Notify Mbaasy of, and add metadata to Android purchases and subscription receipts using this API.

**Note:** This API endpoint expects the `INAPP_PURCHASE_DATA` and `INAPP_DATA_SIGNATURE` properties provided by the [getBuyIntent()](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_reference.html#getBuyIntent) method to be intact. If this is not available you may use the [Legacy API endpoint](/client_api/legacy_google_play/) to send individual properties.

**âš  Requires [Authentication](/client_api/authentication/).**

## HTTP endpoint
