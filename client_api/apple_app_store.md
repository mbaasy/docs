## JSON request body

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `receipt`[^man] | String | A Base64 encoded string containing the receipt. |
| `country_code`[^opt] [^country-code] | String | [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) country code of the end user's App Store region. [See country_code footnote](#fn:country-code). |
| `identifier_for_vendor`[^opt] | String | The [[UIDevice identifierForVendor](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uidevice#//apple_ref/occ/instp/UIDevice/identifierForVendor)]. |
| `user_identifier`[^opt] | String | User ID corresponding to your user database |
| `ip_address`[^opt] | String | V4 or V6 IP address of the end user. Defaults to the network request IP if omitted, send `NULL` to prevent the IP address from being stored. |
| `metadata`[^opt] | Object | Store any arbitrary data to be recorded against the purchase order. e.g. Campaign ID or prices. |

[^man]: This property is **mandatory**.

[^opt]: This property is **optional**.

[^country-code]: The `country_code` property is dependent on the user's App Store region (which is not necessarily their current, physical location). It is accessible from the [priceLocale](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skproduct/1506145-pricelocale) instance property on the [SKProduct](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skproduct) object of any of your available products.

    The [priceLocale](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skproduct/1506145-pricelocale) instance extends from the [Locale](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale) structure and can be cast as a [NSLocale](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nslocale) instance.

    Using the [CFLocaleGetValue](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/1543547-cflocalegetvalue?language=objc) function, you can pass the [NSLocale](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nslocale) instance and the [kCFLocaleCountryCode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/kcflocalecountrycode?language=objc) key property to return the country code associated to the user's App store account.

    Here is a quick example in Objective-C:

    ```objc
    - (void)productsRequest:(SKProductsRequest *)request didReceiveResponse:(SKProductsResponse *)response
    {
        SKProduct *product = [response.products objectAtIndex:0]; // Get the first product
        NSLocale* priceLocale = product.priceLocale; // Get the priceLocale
        NSString *countryCode = (NSString*)CFLocaleGetValue((CFLocaleRef)priceLocale, kCFLocaleCountryCode); // Get the country code
    }
    ```
